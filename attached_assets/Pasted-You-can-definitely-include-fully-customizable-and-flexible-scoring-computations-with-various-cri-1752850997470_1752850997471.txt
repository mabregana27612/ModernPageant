You can definitely include **fully customizable and flexible scoring computations** with various criteria in your pageant system, including options for:

- **Weighted scoring** (assigning different weights or percentages to criteria),
- **Averaging scores** across judges and categories,
- **Raw score totals**,
- **Ranking-based scoring**, and
- **Resetting scores to zero for a top 5 finalist round** (restarting the scoring computation in later competition phases).

This aligns with well-established pageant scoring methodologies, where multiple categories are scored, weighted, and combined for final results, and the scoring system resets or switches methods at specific stages like the top 5 finalists[1][2][3][5][6].

### How to describe this requirement for your Replit project prompt

Add this section to your earlier prompt to specify **custom computation and dynamic criteria creation**:

### ⚙️ Customizable Scoring & Criteria Computation

- Provide event organizers/admins the ability to **define any number of competition criteria/categories** (e.g., Interview, Talent, Evening Gown, On-Stage Question)
- Allow **weight assignments per criterion** (e.g., Interview 30%, Talent 40%, Evening Gown 30%)
- Support different scoring methods for each competition phase:
  - **Averaging** scores from multiple judges per criterion
  - **Weighted sum** of category scores for the total contestant score
  - **Raw score total** option (sum scores without weight)
  - **Ranking method** (assign points based on judges’ rankings)
- Ability to **reset/zero scores at a particular round/stage**, e.g. after preliminaries and before top 5
  - Scores from earlier rounds can be archived but excluded from final calculation
  - Top 5 scoring uses fresh criteria or a different computation method
- Configurable **tie-breaking rules**, e.g., by prioritized categories such as Interview then Talent
- Display **score breakdowns** per contestant for transparency

### How this fits into the system:

- **Admin panel** to build and adjust competition criteria and weights dynamically per event
- **Judges’ interfaces** to input scores per category
- **Backend logic** that calculates final contestant scores following the selected computation method for each event phase
- **Frontend display** to show score summaries, rankings, and analytics with detailed component-wise data

### Updated Replit prompt excerpt including this:

> Extend the pageant system backend and admin UI to allow **fully customizable scoring criteria and computation methods**:
> - Admins can add/edit/remove scoring categories with adjustable weights
> - Support averaging, weighted sums, raw totals, and ranking-based calculations
> - Include an option to **reset scores to zero** before final rounds such as the top 5, discarding prior scores for the final tally
> - Handle tie-breaks using prioritized criteria
> - Present detailed scoring breakdowns and overall rankings in real-time
>  
> Combine this with Facebook engagement voting, Google email notifications, and interactive analytics dashboards for a complete, professional pageant solution.

This approach follows proven pageant judging methods while offering flexibility for different contest rules and phases[1][2][3][5][6].
